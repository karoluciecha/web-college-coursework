            <h1>Computer Network</h1>
            <p>A computer network is a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computers</a> sharing resources located on or provided by network nodes. Computers use common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol">communication protocols</a> over digital interconnections to communicate with each other. These interconnections are made up of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network">telecommunication network</a> technologies based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology">network topologies</a>.</p>
            <p>The nodes of a computer network can include personal computers, servers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networking_hardware">networking hardware</a>, or other specialized or general-purpose <a host="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(network)">hosts</a>. They are identified by network addresses and may have hostnames. Hostnames serve as memorable labels for the nodes and are rarely changed after initial assignment. Network addresses serve for locating and identifying the nodes by communication protocols such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">Internet Protocol</a>.</p>
            <p>Computer networks may be classified by many criteria, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_medium">transmission medium</a> used to carry signals, bandwidth, communications protocols to organize network traffic, the network size, the topology, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_traffic_control">traffic control</a> mechanisms, and organizational intent.</p>
            <p>Computer networks support many applications and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_service">services</a>, such as access to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a>, digital video and audio, shared use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_server">application and storage servers</a>, printers and fax machines, and use of email and instant messaging applications.</p>
