		<h1>Types of machine learning metrics</h1>
		<p>There are quite a few metrics out there to evaluate ML models in different applications. Most of them can be put into two categories based on the types of predictions in ML models.</p>

		<h2>Classification</h2>

		<p>Classification is a prediction type used to give the output variable in the form of categories with similar attributes. For example, such models can provide binary output such as sorting spam and non-spam messages.</p>

		<p>Some of the popular classification metrics are:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>accuracy</li>
			<li>precision</li>
			<li>recall</li>
			<li>f1 Score</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Regression</h2>

		<p>Regression is a kind of prediction where the output variable is numerical, not categorical (as opposed to classification). The output is continuous. For example, it can help with predicting a patientâ€™s length of stay in a hospital.</p>

		<p>Some of the popular regression metrics are: </p>

		<ul>
			<li><span>mse</span> (Mean Squared Error)</li>
			<li><span>rmse</span> (Root Mean Squared Error)</li>
			<li><span>mae</span> (Mean Absolute Error)</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Depending on the use case, using a single metric may not provide you with the complete picture of the problem you are solving. So, you may want to use a few metrics to better evaluate your models.</p>
